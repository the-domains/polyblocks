I've been working with [Polymer][0] for a few weeks now, and figured documenting everything that I learn along the way would be a great way to test out [The Grid][1]. If I'm lucky, someone will find this useful besides myself, and then it'll all be worth it. 

I've been focused on bigger-picture, overall "How do I get started with Polymer" and "How does a company effectively use Polymer across teams?" type questions, the DevOps work to make that a reality, and I'm just starting to dig deep into coding Web Components with Polymer. So my initial posts will probably be scattered as I throw up summaries of notes I've take as well as new things I learn, but that's what learning is all about :-)
