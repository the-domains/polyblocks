As best I can tell, there are 3 main Polymer-related organizations on GitHub where the Polymer team is actively contributing to:

* [**Polymer**][0] - core libraries like [Polymer itself][1] & [web-component-tester][2]
* **[Polymer Elements][3]** - all of the elements from the [Polymer Element Catalog][4]
* [**Polymer Labs**][5] - tools for use with Polymer such as [polyserve][6], [polylint][7], and [crisper][8]

They're active in other Web Component-related orgs as well such as the official [Web Components][9] and [Google Web Components][10] organizations, but for your typical web developer using Polymer, I think the 3 orgs above are the ones we should be keeping our eyes on.
